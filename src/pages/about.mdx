<div class="p-note">
Hi! My name is <span class="p-name">AndrÃ©s Correa Casablanca</span> (but please,
call me Andreu).

I've been developing software professionally for over 12 years, and
I'm currently working as a **<span class="p-job-title">Senior Software Engineer</span>**
at <a href="https://nearform.com" class="p-org">NearForm</a>, while occasionally
contributing to some [FLOSS projects](/projects).

I love mathematics, science and engineering... but, more honestly: I basically
love everything, and I struggle when I have to choose what spend my time on. I
just have to prioritise somehow.
