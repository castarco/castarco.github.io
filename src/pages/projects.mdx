## Related to past employers

Part of my work in these projects (Adsmurai's, Unit-E) doesn't seem properly
attributed to me because the email used to commit was detached from my Github
account.

- [JOIN's gRPC TS Client library](https://github.com/join-com/grpc)
- [JOIN's gRPC -> TS Code Generator](https://github.com/join-com/protoc-gen-ts)
- [Unit-E](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e) - A PoS cryptocurency project that
  got cancelled. Just for the record: I'm not into crypto/blockchain anymore.
- [Adsmurai's PHP Currency lib](https://github.com/Adsmurai/Currency)

## Legacy/Archived

- [`@lyrasearch/plugin-astro`](https://github.com/lyrasearch/plugin-astro) - A
  [Lyra](https://lyrajs.io) integration for [Astro](https://astro.build).
- [Avatar-CLI](https://avatar-cli.dev): My first "serious" project made in Rust,
  to pin projects' tools versions by relying on tons of Docker-related trickery.
- [Jupyter-PHP](https://github.com/Litipk/Jupyter-PHP): A Jupyter Notebook
  "kernel", to execute PHP code inside Jupyter. I discontinued it after my laptop
  was stolen, and a lot of pending work was lost with it.
- [PHP-BigNumbers](https://github.com/Litipk/php-bignumbers) - A library to work
  with arbitrary precision decimal numbers.
- [ColorSharp](https://github.com/castarco/ColorSharp) - A .NET/Mono library to
  handle color spaces and light spectrums.
- [Platano Indexer](https://github.com/Litipk/platano-indexer) - a horrible
  text indexer, all because ElasticSearch documentation was scarce at the time ðŸ¤·.
